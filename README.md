Our Vision

To provide a simple to use decentralized social media network, with a familiar interface, free of censorship, advertising and government intervention.

A platform where all your social media stays right on your computer where you control it and others can request it. No accounts or personal information are required that can be mined and sold to advertisers or shared with 'authorities'.

No subjective community standards, no arbitrary 'fact checking', no blocking or deletion of content, no central 'authority' molding public opinion along their socio-political lines. Users are free to see whatever they want, from whomever they want and they are free to ignore whatever they want.

By its design it’s impossible for anyone to censor you, serve ads or see your Qaoss timeline without your permission. Everyone runs their own social media timeline on their computer and we connect directly to one another.

Qaoss is an Open Source project built out of the passion for individual freedom and dignity. It's not meant to be a replacement for centralized social media but to complement it, one of many alternatives.

Installation

Download the qaoss zip file and unzip all its contents to a folder on your local computer where you have full access. 
The "documents" folder works nice.

Double click the install.bat file and when asked for a qaoss name, choose something unique to make sure it's not already
in use by someone else. This is the qaoss name others will use to connect with you. It can be anything such as:
'bobaloo' or 'creampie86', just make it unique enough.

**********************************************************
*Important* The qaoss name must be all one word. 
**********************************************************

When the install completes, double click the Launch.bat file in the qaoss folder. 
Your personal Qaoss social media website should be up and running.

Open a browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar to begin testing.

Go to your browsers “Settings” and configure “Downloads” to ask where to save each time. When you share someone's post on your timeline
download it to (your Qaoss installation folder)\archives\shares.
